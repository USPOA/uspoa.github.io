**5. Principles**
   - You have to pay tax for every transaction initiated. The tax amount depends on how much money you have. Tax increases by 5% if you have above 10K phees and increases 10% every 50K phees you have. That means if you have 475000 phees, your tax rate will double.
   - If you have a contract with somebody that you will have to pay them income for their services, you cannot pay them less than 2 phays. a phay is 1 phees per day. If you pay them less than 2 phays, you will be fined the amount you owe to the employee.
   - You can only spend a maximum of 10K phees per week, or 10K pheeks to slow inflation. However you can pay 10K pheeks for an amount of weeks to pay it off.
   - You cannot price a product more than 1.5 times its original price in a single week, and 2 times its original in less than a month. however if the demand increases by 2 times, you may increase it to 1.5 in a week.
