The Angulator has the authority to respond with force, including the right to **raid the offender's home** and take necessary actions to protect the empire.

6. **Zepting Law**:  
   - **No Claiming of Property Without Ownership**: Royal subjects are prohibited from claiming any property, resources, or assets that do not belong to them.
